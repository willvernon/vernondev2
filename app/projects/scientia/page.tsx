				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]">Project Overview</h1>
				<p>
					I came up with the idea of a better way to track assignments
					given the very lackluster of school based organizational tools in
					2018-19, i took matters into my own hands to come up with a app
					that specifically tailored to mine and many other college
					students needs at the time. I would go on to handle everything
					from design to development (my first time coding with React
					Native) and then test possible api features with my current
					school work. This is how I built a prototype for the App.

				<h3 className="mt-5 font-bold">Quantitative Research</h3>
				<p>
					I interviewed a few student friends of mine and learned about
					what their needs where and how they were staying organized in
					order to gather the information I needed. These students spoke to
					me on how they managed their productive strategies whether it was
					digital or pen and paper. Here are the findings:
				</p>
				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">
					<div>
						<h3 className="mt-6 font-bold">✅ Positives</h3>

						<li className="p-1">
							Interviewees regard convenience as a priority when it comes
							to work management 
						</li>
						<li className="p-1">
							Interviewees use lots of journaling and the reminders app
							in their phone.
						</li>
						<li className="p-1">
							Interviewees also mentioned that a digital tool is much
							needed
						</li>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3 className="mt-6 font-bold">❌ Negatives</h3>
						<li className="p-1">
							Interviewees mentioned that it needs to be very straight
							forward and not be added to the struggle of organization
						</li>
						<li className="p-1">
							Learning a new organization method can be time restrictive
						</li>
						<li className="p-1">
							Users of all levels of software knowledge while also
							staying feature strong
						</li>
						<li className="p-1">
							Online School systems can make organization impossible
						</li>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3 className="mt-5 font-bold">Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>
					👉🏼 I observed that organization and assignment management is very
					important when keeping a strong academic and personal life
					mixture, having each assignment accounted for allows for better
					time management…
				</p>
				<h3 className="mt-5 font-bold">Definition</h3>
				<p>Recommendations from students</p>
				<h3 className="mt-5 font-bold">Recommendations</h3>

				<li className="p-1">
					Having a sorting system based on due date, priority, or name
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					Being able to connect to the online school system to download
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					Being able to have reminders and notes attached to each other
				</li>
				<br />
				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]">Solution Phase</h1>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					After going through all the information and recommendations i
					have received i went along and made some rough sketches about how
					i think it should look and run:
				</p>
				<br />
				<h2>Sketches & Paper Prototypes</h2>
				<p>
					After going through a few paper sketches i came to that final
					design and went to make wireframes and user flows. My key was to
					keep the pages and navigation to a minimum to keep quickness a
					priority.

				<h2>Prototype</h2>
				<p>
					I built a clickable prototype, with Figma and started testing out

				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]">Iteration Phase</h1>
				<h2 className="font-bold">Testing</h2>
				<br />
				<li className="p-1">
					Reduce how long it takes to create new reminders

				<li className="p-1">
					Display Reminders earlier to make quickness priority, try
					condense Assignment information into one card
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					More specific and straight forward user flow through

				<p>Simplifying to allow consistent and smooth use process.</p>

				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]"> Summary </h1>
				<br />
				<h2 className="font-bold">👎 Limitations</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					There are limitations when it comes to building a task app. Here
					I discuss why these solutions have its trade-offs:
				</p>
				<br />
				<li className="p-1">
					User needs to have a smartphone or device laptop with an internet
					connection otherwise this solution will not solve their
					organization and task management will only save to device till
					connection is reestablished.
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					Takes time to establish confidence and reliance on the app.
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					Everyone is very different in the way they like to stay organized
					so building to include everyone can be difficult.
				</li>
				<br />
				<h2 className="font-bold">👍 Value</h2>
				<br />
				<p>So why build an Task App?</p>
				<br />
				<li className="p-1">
					The app a way to manage the school workload that can be a lot
					with, documents, projects, and all kinds of other school
					materials all in one easy to use application.
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					It was only made for students specifically but could easily be
					modified to allow all kinds of task managing.
				</li>
				<li className="p-1">Convenience is a huge factor.</li>
				<li className="p-1">
					Mobile device usage in schools is only becoming more and more
					reliant on good software to support the emerging digitization of
					school.
