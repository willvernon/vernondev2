				<h3>Quantitative Research</h3>
				<p>
					Over the weekend, I interviewed multiple contractors and learned
					about what their needs where and how they were staying
					organized in order to gather the information I needed. These
					adults spoke to me on a 1:1 user research where I had a
					pre-written questions. Here are the findings:
				</p>
				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">
					<div>
						<h3>✅ Positives</h3>
						<ul>
							<li className="p-2">
								Interviewees regard convenience as a priority when it
								comes to Task management
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								Interviewees use apps and websites daily and have
								experience in using digital task and organizational
								products  and/or services
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								Interviewees commented that Security is very important
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								The majority of interviewees established many
								different systems to organize invoices, receipts, and
								job details.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>❌ Negatives</h3>
						<ul>
							<li className="p-2">
								Interviewees regarded added an extra step could turn
								them away from utilizing the system
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								Learning a new intranet system from the ground up is
								time extensive
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								Catering to all levels of tech knowledge while also
								staying effective
							</li>
							<li className="p-2">
								Two interviewees find the system confusing i.e.
								uploading documents and pictures
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
				<p>
					👉🏼 We have observed that organization and task management is a
					must have when   running a smooth operation, having each
					contractor use their own methods of   organization lead to lots
					of misunderstandings and loss of job details…
				</p>
				<h3>Definition</h3>
				<p>Recommendations from contractors and the CEO</p>
				<h3>Recommendations</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Develop a System that allows contractors to access travel
						information, plan their jobs and search for the nearest points
						of interest
					</li>
					<li>
						Develop a Task Manager that can tell users relevant
						information regarding jobs and company updates.
					</li>
					<li>
						Develop an app that shows contractor profiles with skills,
						availability, and CVI.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]">Solution Phase</h1>
				<h2>Ideation</h2>
				<p>
					After deciding to build a Intranet, I proceed to do some rough
					sketches including the overall user flow - this is important as I
					wanted the platform to perform without information overload on
					each screen especially when dealing with high volumes of
					information
					<br />
					input: (Many of the in depth screens have been removed per NDA)
				</p>
				<h2>Sketches & Paper Prototypes</h2>
				<p>
					With the first round of usability tests completed using the paper
					prototype, I moved on to creating refined wireframes & user flows
					with annotated wireframes.
				</p>
				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
					<div className="">
						<Image
							alt="Sketch"
							width={400}
							quality={100}
							src={sketch}
							className="rounded-md"
						/>
					</div>
					<div className="">
						<Image
							alt="Mock"
							width={400}
							quality={100}
							src={mock}
							className="rounded-md"
						/>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Wireframes & User Flows</h2>
				<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
					<div className="">
						<Image
							alt="Sketch"
							width={400}
							quality={100}
							src={wire1}
							className="rounded-md"

					</div>
					<div className="">
						<Image
							alt="Mock"
							width={400}
							quality={100}
							src={wire2}
							className="rounded-md"
						/>
					</div>
				</div>
				<h2>Prototype</h2>
				<p>
					I built a clickable prototype, with Figma and started testing out
					features
				</p>
				<br />
				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]">Iteration Phase</h1>
				<h2>Testing</h2>
				<li>Fixing usability issues</li>
				<li>Reduce steps to upload documents - currently 5 steps</li>
				<li>
					Display Tasks earlier to provide value sooner, try condensing job
					information into one card
				</li>
				<li>
					More specific and straight forward directions and steps to edit
					job screen
				</li>
				<li>
					Start with Tasks with more accurate notifications of new tasks
					and jobs.
				</li>
				<li>
					One common feedback is how they liked the simple apps on the home
					screen so theres no scrolling or hunting for what they needed to
					find.
				</li>
				<br />
				<h2>Iterations</h2>
				<p>Simplifying to allow consistent information and usability.</p>
				<br />
				<h1 className="text-[#e64c33]"> Summary </h1>
				<h2>👎 Limitations</h2>
				<p>
					There are limitations when it comes to building a intranet. Here
					I discuss why these solutions have its trade-offs:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						User needs to have a smartphone or device laptop with an
						internet connection otherwise this solution will not solve
						their organization and task management.
					</li>
					<li>
						Takes time to establish familiarity and directions for users
						to use the system confidently.
					</li>
					<li>
						Using the task platform provides a wide range of limitations
						(and value, discussed below), for example, limited interaction
						and communication to provide a accurate information, limited
						usability without a good cell connection, and so on.
					</li>
					<li>
						No advanced filtering options that some power users might be
						familiar with, especially with other Organization apps
						specifically because the Admin required the ability to control
						who has access to what information.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>👍 Value</h2>
				<p>
					So why build an Intranet and not some other digital solution to
					solve the problem?
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The Intranet  is a great way to manage people, document,
						projects, and all kinds of other business materials all in one
						easy to use and secure application.
					</li>
					<li>
						The solution was designed for mobile and web so it does not
						need take into account older versions of iOS or Android thus
						limiting the number of requirements.
					</li>
					<li>
						Convenience is a huge factor when deciding whether or not to
						use a Intranet versus any other traditional organizational
						tools. Most people have had experience with corporate intranet
						thus making adoption pretty easy.
					</li>
					<li>
						Mobile device usage has taken over, By leveraging existing
						behavior on their devices, we know that majority of users can
						easily use a mobile app rather than requiring them to use only
						desktop.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<p>
					Utilizing everything learned to put the final touches on the app
					and smooth out any of the rough edges to make it a easy and
					straight forward solution.
				</p>
				<p>1. Build all interactions</p>
				<p>
					The prototype was very limited and did not show the full range of
					the design solution thus requiring a lot of imagination from the
					user.
				</p>
				<p>2. Increase fidelity of the prototype</p>
				<p>
					Making the experience feel natural and making sure that the
					testers and users know that we want them to find issues so that
					we can properly fix and adapt to needs and wants.
